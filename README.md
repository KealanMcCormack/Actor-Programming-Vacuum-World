DDD Eis Vacuum World

This project is an implementation of the EIS vacuum world - https://github.com/eishub/vacuumworld

It is written in Astra - http://astralanguage.com/wordpress/

It was developed in collaboration with https://github.com/Lukadolla and https://github.com/GerardColman

**How To Run**

Simply clone the project and then run mvn in the main directory.

This should compile and run the project.

Windows users should beware that Astra has a tendency to orphan it's processes, 
so these may need to be killed via task manager.

**Extra Info**

The goal in this scenario is to create agents and have them interact with the world. 
In this case their goal is to clean dust from the tiles where it is randomly generated. 

Their is a visual element to the environment which allow you to watch the vacuums at work.

Quite satisfying really.

Also would have liked to keep the original projects commit history and information,
however the report added to the original repo contained more information than a public github project needed
